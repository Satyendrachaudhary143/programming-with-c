# C Programming: Learn and Practice

Welcome to the **C Programming** project!

This repository is a personal journey into learning the C programming language. My name is **Satyendra Chaudhary**, and I am not a professional teacher—I'm a fellow learner exploring C step by step. All the code, explanations, and practice questions here are written by me as I study and practice C programming. If you are also learning C, I hope this resource helps and motivates you!
